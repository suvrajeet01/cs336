# Vision Statement
We want to expand on the functionality of the website [sleepyti.me](sleepyti.me). Sleepti.me allows you to determine the best time to fall asleep to wake up the next day feeling well rested by counting sleep cycles. Our additions to the app will allow you to plan out your weeks sleep and allow you to download an ics event file to integrate with your calendar. [Studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.12712) have shown that catching up on lost sleep on weekends reverses the health effects of not getting enough sleep. The app will allow you to plan out how much extra sleep you will need on the weekends in order to balance out lost sleep during the week. The length of a sleep cycle varies from person to person. Using an app like [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/) you can determine how long your sleep cycles are and how long it takes for you to fall asleep. When planning your sleep for the week, the app will allow you to specify parameters like sleep cycle length and time to fall asleep.
