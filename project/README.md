# Project Proposal
I often use the website [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/), to determine what time I need to fall asleep or when I wake up. The site counts in reverse sleep cycles (1.5 hours) to determine when you should fall asleep. The website is very simple and has a lot of features that could be added. This project aims to add some of them. The app will allow you to plan out when you want to go to sleep and wake up each day and integrate with your calendar allowing you to recieve alerts letting you know it's time to get ready for bed and when to be in bed to wake up well rested. It's very often that you won't be able to reach 4-6 sleep cycles some nights. [Studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.12712) have shown that catching up on lost sleep on weekends reverses the health effects of not getting enough sleep. The app will allow you to plan out how much extra sleep you will need on the weekends in order to balance out lost sleep during the week. The length of a sleep cycle varies from person to person. Using an app like [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/) you can determine how long your sleep cycles are and how long it takes for you to fall asleep. When planning your sleep for the week, the app will allow you to specify parameters like sleep cycle length and time to fall asleep.
