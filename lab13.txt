Exercise 13.1

What benefit did using the React Router bring to the application?
    It allows you to have different URLs for different pieces of the application
Which is better, hash history or browser history?
    Hash requires less configuration but doesn't produce urls that looks nice while browser history does with the tradeoff of more configuration
Why does the server (either Webpack Dev Server or the Express server) have to be modified to support the browser history? Compare this with the hash-based server demonstrated in class, which didn't require such modifications.
    The server needs to be able to handle all URLs even though the URLs dont really exist since they are just rewritten. With hash based history state is tracked with the URL and therefore no additional configuration is required.
